## üè≠ Industrial Layout Design ‚Äì Circular Tank Arrangement

Designed and drafted a structural layout with circular tanks using AutoCAD, emphasizing precision and professional engineering standards.

### Highlights
- Tank layout with accurate diameters and spacing
- Staircase design with thread and riser dimensions
- Scaled drawing (1:1) with title block formatting
- Applied annotations, hatching, and detailing

## üè† Residential House Layout Design

Created a comprehensive 2D residential house plan, including floor plans, elevation, section views, and site plan, following architectural drafting standards.

### Highlights
- Floor plans with room dimensions and circulation space
- Elevation and sectional views for structural visualization
- Area table and schedule of openings for detailing
- Staircase design (Thread: 0.25 m, Riser: 0.17 m, Width: 0.90 m)
- Scaled drawing (1:100) with annotations and title block
